# Info.memo

Fancy website, that helps with remembering things.

Live demo: https://info-memo.web.app/

For now it only makes sense to check it on 1440 x 1024 resolution, because page is in development and RWD was not programmed yet. (and don't spam f5, cuz I will program auto login tmw, and page will break if you refresh in placee where you should be loged-in)
